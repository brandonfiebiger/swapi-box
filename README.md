## Project Goals

* Get comfortable whipping together React components with the additional complexity of implementing React Router.
* Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
* Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
* Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
* Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
* Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
* Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
